🧩 How Shopify Consent API Integration Works

On installation, the Seers app automatically loads the Shopify Consent Tracking API by calling:

window.Shopify.loadFeatures([
  {
    name: 'consent-tracking-api',
    version: '0.1',
  },
], function (error) {
  if (error) return;
});


This ensures that the CustomerPrivacyAPI is available on your storefront.

Once initialised, our banner script (cb.js) communicates directly with Shopify’s API.
When a user provides consent on the banner:

The consent data is sent to Shopify’s Consent Tracking API.

Shopify records the consent preferences (Analytics, Marketing, Preferences, etc.).

Third-party tags (like GA4, Meta, TikTok) follow Shopify’s consent rules automatically.

This real-time communication ensures that your store always respects user privacy settings across all integrated platforms.


🔐 Compliance Workflow

Banner Displayed:
The AI-driven consent banner is automatically displayed on your storefront.

User Interaction:
Visitors can accept, reject, or customise their cookie preferences.

Shopify Consent Sync:
When consent is given, Seers automatically triggers Shopify’s CustomerPrivacyAPI to update tracking preferences.

Cookie Control:
Cookies are auto-blocked or allowed based on the user’s choices, ensuring zero manual effort.

Audit & Reporting:
All consent decisions are logged and made available in compliance reports under your Seers dashboard.

📊 Example Consent Flow

1. On install, the app loads Shopify’s Consent Tracking API script:

<script src="https://cdn.shopify.com/shopifycloud/consent-tracking-api/v0.1/consent-tracking-api.js" type="module" defer></script>


2. Our cb.js script manages banner behaviour and consent events:

    Shopify.customerPrivacy.setTrackingConsent({
    analytics: true,
    marketing: false,
    preferences: true
    });


3. The user’s consent choice automatically updates Shopify’s internal tracking logic.
